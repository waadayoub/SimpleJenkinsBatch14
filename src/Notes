CI/CD:
Continuous integration and continuous development
All of the software that we use weather it's a website or app or any operating system
they're in continuous state of change. We need to continuously develop and update these software
so the customers can use the latest features. Jenkins is one such software that will help us automate
this process.
1)Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine,
Developer pushes the code to the development server. He verifies the changes and runs a few test cases
to make sure all works fine.
2)Once all looks good QA will request to deploy the changes on the QA server. We need to take approvals from
team leads or managers, which slows down the process.
3)Once all looks on QA server take approval from head of team, write an email again to deploy all changes to staging server.
4) Once all looks good on the staging, do same for production.
